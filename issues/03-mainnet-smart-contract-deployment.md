# Mainnet Smart Contract Deployment

**Labels:** `deployment`, `mainnet`, `critical`, `phase-2`  
**Milestone:** Phase 2 - Production  
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 weeks  
**Token Reward:** 4,000,000 $BDNS  

## Summary

Deploy all Bitcoin DNS smart contracts to BSV mainnet with production-grade security, monitoring, and upgrade mechanisms.

## Description

This issue covers the complete deployment of the Bitcoin DNS smart contract suite to BSV mainnet, including governance contracts, NFT containers, revenue distribution, and domain registry. This is a critical milestone for moving from testnet to production operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Contract Suite Deployment
- [ ] Deploy DomainRegistry contract as the main entry point
- [ ] Deploy GovernanceFactory for creating domain governance contracts
- [ ] Deploy NFTContainerFactory for tokenized shares
- [ ] Deploy RevenueDistributor for X402 payment handling
- [ ] Deploy ProxyAdmin for upgradeable contract management

### Security Infrastructure
- [ ] Implement multi-signature admin controls (3-of-5 threshold)
- [ ] Set up timelock contracts for critical parameter changes
- [ ] Deploy contract pause mechanisms for emergency situations
- [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC) system

### Upgrade Mechanisms
- [ ] Deploy proxy contracts for upgradeability
- [ ] Create upgrade proposal and voting system
- [ ] Implement emergency upgrade procedures
- [ ] Set up contract version management

### Monitoring and Analytics
- [ ] Deploy event monitoring infrastructure
- [ ] Create real-time contract health dashboards
- [ ] Implement alerting for critical contract events
- [ ] Set up transaction cost monitoring

## Technical Requirements

### Contract Architecture
```
MainnetDeployment/
├── DomainRegistry.sol          # Main domain registration
├── GovernanceFactory.sol       # Creates governance contracts
├── NFTContainerFactory.sol     # Creates share containers
├── RevenueDistributor.sol      # Handles X402 payments
├── ProxyAdmin.sol              # Manages contract upgrades
├── Timelock.sol               # Time-delayed admin actions
└── EmergencyPause.sol         # Circuit breaker
```

### Deployment Configuration
```javascript
const MAINNET_CONFIG = {
  network: 'bsv-mainnet',
  admin: {
    multiSig: '1ADMIN_MULTISIG_ADDRESS',
    timelock: 24 * 60 * 60, // 24 hours
    threshold: 3, // 3 of 5 signatures
  },
  governance: {
    votingPeriod: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 7 days
    minApprovalThreshold: 51, // 51%
    proposalDeposit: 100000, // satoshis
  },
  fees: {
    domainRegistration: 50000, // satoshis
    governanceProposal: 10000, // satoshis
    shareTransfer: 1000, // satoshis
  }
};
```

### Security Measures
- **Admin Keys:** Hardware wallet cold storage
- **Emergency Contacts:** 24/7 monitoring team
- **Incident Response:** Automated pause triggers
- **Audit Trail:** All admin actions logged on-chain

## Deployment Process

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Complete security audit by certified firm
- [ ] Formal verification of critical contracts
- [ ] Stress testing with realistic transaction volumes
- [ ] Gas optimization and cost analysis
- [ ] Legal review and compliance check

### Deployment Steps
1. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - Configure BSV mainnet RPC endpoints
   - Set up deployment wallet with sufficient BSV
   - Prepare monitoring and alerting systems

2. **Contract Deployment**
   - Deploy implementation contracts
   - Deploy proxy contracts and factories
   - Initialize with production parameters
   - Verify contracts on BSV explorer

3. **Access Control Setup**
   - Transfer ownership to multi-sig wallet
   - Configure role assignments
   - Set up timelock parameters
   - Test emergency procedures

4. **Integration Testing**
   - Test all contract interactions
   - Verify frontend integration
   - Test upgrade procedures
   - Validate monitoring systems

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] All contracts deployed and verified
- [ ] Frontend successfully interacts with mainnet contracts
- [ ] Governance voting works with real tokens
- [ ] Revenue distribution executes real payments
- [ ] Emergency procedures tested and documented

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Contract Bugs:** Comprehensive testing and formal verification
- **Gas Price Volatility:** Dynamic fee adjustment mechanisms
- **Network Congestion:** Transaction queuing and retry logic
- **Upgrade Failures:** Rollback procedures and contract pausing

### Operational Risks
- **Key Management:** Hardware wallets and secure storage
- **Team Availability:** 24/7 monitoring and incident response
- **Regulatory Changes:** Legal compliance monitoring
- **Market Volatility:** Treasury management and BSV reserves

### Security Risks
- **Admin Key Compromise:** Multi-sig with geographic distribution
- **Contract Exploitation:** Bug bounty and continuous monitoring
- **Frontend Attacks:** Secure deployment and content integrity
- **Social Engineering:** Team security training and procedures

## Monitoring Infrastructure

### On-Chain Monitoring
```javascript
// Critical events to monitor
const CRITICAL_EVENTS = [
  'DomainRegistered',
  'GovernanceProposalCreated', 
  'SharesTransferred',
  'RevenueDistributed',
  'ContractPaused',
  'AdminActionExecuted'
];

// Alert thresholds
const ALERT_THRESHOLDS = {
  gasPrice: 100, // gwei
  failedTransactions: 5, // per hour
  unusualVolume: 10000, // transactions per hour
  treasuryBalance: 1000000 // minimum satoshis
};
```

### Dashboard Metrics
- Total domains registered
- Active governance proposals
- Revenue generated and distributed
- Share trading volume
- Contract health scores

## Compliance and Legal

### Regulatory Compliance
- [ ] Legal entity establishment for contract ownership
- [ ] Compliance with applicable securities regulations
- [ ] Terms of service and privacy policy updates
- [ ] KYC/AML procedures for large shareholders

### Documentation
- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] Smart contract function reference
- [ ] Emergency procedures manual
- [ ] User guides and tutorials
