# NFT Container Implementation

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `nft`, `smart-contracts`, `phase-1`  
**Milestone:** Phase 1 - Foundation  
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks  
**Token Reward:** 2,500,000 $BDNS  

## Summary

Implement NFT containers for tokenized domain shares, enabling shareholders to own, trade, and govern domain assets through blockchain-native tokens.

## Description

Create an NFT container system where domain shares are represented as individual NFTs within a container. Each domain gets its own container, and shares within that container can be traded while maintaining governance rights.

## Acceptance Criteria

### NFT Container Contract
- [ ] Deploy NFT container smart contract to BSV
- [ ] Implement ERC-721 compatible interface for shares
- [ ] Support batch minting of initial share distribution
- [ ] Enable container-level metadata for domain information

### Share Management
- [ ] Create UI for viewing owned domain shares
- [ ] Implement share transfer functionality
- [ ] Add share splitting/merging capabilities
- [ ] Display voting power based on share ownership

### Trading Interface
- [ ] Build marketplace for buying/selling shares
- [ ] Implement price discovery mechanisms
- [ ] Add order book and matching engine
- [ ] Support auction-style sales for new domains

### Governance Integration
- [ ] Link NFT ownership to voting rights
- [ ] Implement vote delegation functionality
- [ ] Track governance participation rewards
- [ ] Add shareholder communication tools

## Technical Requirements

### NFT Container Contract
```solidity
contract DomainShareContainer {
    struct DomainInfo {
        string subdomain;
        uint256 totalShares;
        uint256 createdAt;
        address creator;
        mapping(uint256 => uint256) shareValues;
    }
    
    function mintShares(string subdomain, address[] recipients, uint256[] amounts) external;
    function transferShare(uint256 shareId, address to) external;
    function getVotingPower(address holder, string subdomain) external view returns (uint256);
    function splitShare(uint256 shareId, uint256[] amounts) external;
    function mergeShares(uint256[] shareIds) external returns (uint256);
}
```

### Frontend Components
- `SharePortfolio.tsx` - Display owned shares across domains
- `ShareMarketplace.tsx` - Buy/sell interface
- `ShareGovernance.tsx` - Voting interface with share weighting
- `ShareTransfer.tsx` - Transfer and delegation UI

### API Endpoints
```typescript
// Required API routes
POST /api/shares/mint        // Mint new shares for domain
GET  /api/shares/portfolio   // Get user's share portfolio
POST /api/shares/transfer    // Transfer shares between users
GET  /api/shares/marketplace // Get available shares for sale
POST /api/shares/list        // List shares for sale
```

## User Stories

### As a Company
- I want to distribute initial shares to stakeholders during domain setup
- I want to reserve shares for future employee equity programs
- I want to track who owns shares in my domain for governance

### As an Investor
- I want to buy shares in promising domains
- I want to sell shares when domain value increases
- I want to delegate my voting rights to domain experts
- I want to receive revenue proportional to my ownership

### As a Developer
- I want to earn shares as payment for domain development work
- I want to use shares as collateral for development funding
- I want to create tools that integrate with the share system

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Basic NFT Container
- Deploy container contract with minting capability
- Implement basic transfer and ownership tracking
- Create simple UI for viewing owned shares

### Phase 2: Trading Functionality
- Add marketplace contract for peer-to-peer trading
- Implement price discovery and order matching
- Create trading UI with order books

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Add share splitting and merging
- Implement delegation and proxy voting
- Create governance dashboard for shareholders

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for all contract functions
- [ ] Integration tests with existing governance system
- [ ] End-to-end tests for complete share lifecycle
- [ ] Performance tests for large-scale share distributions
- [ ] Security tests for transfer and trading operations

## Security Considerations

- **Ownership Verification:** Ensure only valid share owners can vote
- **Transfer Atomicity:** Prevent double-spending during transfers
- **Marketplace Security:** Protect against front-running and manipulation
- **Delegation Safety:** Prevent malicious delegation attacks

## Dependencies

- Issue #1: BSV Blockchain Integration (required)
- NFT marketplace infrastructure
- Wallet integration for BSV
- IPFS for metadata storage

## Definition of Done

- [ ] NFT container contract deployed and verified
- [ ] All domain shares are properly tokenized
- [ ] Trading marketplace is functional
- [ ] Governance voting uses NFT ownership
- [ ] Revenue distribution works with NFT holders
- [ ] Full test coverage for all components
- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] Documentation and user guides written
