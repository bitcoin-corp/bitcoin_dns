  ): Promise<Transaction>;
  
  submitGovernanceVote(
    proposalId: string, 
    vote: Vote
  ): Promise<TransactionResult>;
  
  distributeRevenue(
    domain: string, 
    recipients: PaymentRecipient[]
  ): Promise<TransactionResult>;
}
```

#### Performance Requirements

- Portal loading: <2s with wallet integration
- Transaction processing: <1 minute end-to-end
- Concurrent users: Support 1000+ simultaneous connections

## Technical Specifications

### BSV Network Configuration
```javascript

  explorerUrl: 'https://whatsonchain.com',
  feeRate: 1, // satoshis per byte
  confirmations: 6, // Required confirmations
};
```
